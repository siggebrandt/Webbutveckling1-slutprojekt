  <h2>Lyrics</h2>
  <p id="lyrics">
    I didn't ask for a free ride
    
    I only asked you to show me a real good time
    
    I never asked for the rainfall
    
    At least I showed up, you showed me nothing at all
    
    It's coming down on me
    
    Water like misery
    
    It's coming down on me
    
    I'm ready, rain on me
    
    I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
    
    Rain on me, rain, rain
    
    Rain on me, rain, rain
    
    I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
    
    Rain on me, rain, rain
    
    Rain on me
    
    ♪
    
    Rain on me
    
    Mmh, oh yeah, baby
    
    Rain on me
    
    Livin' in a world where no one's innocent
    
    Oh, but at least we try, mmh
    
    Gotta live my truth, not keep it bottled in
    
    So I don't lose my mind, baby, yeah
    
    I can feel it on my skin (It's coming down on me)
    
    Teardrops on my face (Water like misery)
    
    Let it wash away my sins (It's coming down on me)
    
    Let it wash away, yeah
    
    I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
    
    Rain on me, rain, rain
    
    Rain on me, rain, rain
    
    I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
    
    Rain on me, rain, rain
    
    Rain (Rain) on (On) me
    
    Rain on me
    
    Rain on me
    
    Oh yeah, yeah
    
    Rain on me, ooh yeah
    
    Rain on me
    
    Rain on me, ooh
    
    Hands up to the sky
    
    I'll be your galaxy
    
    I'm about to fly
    
    Rain on me, tsunami
    
    Hands up to the sky
    
    I'll be your galaxy
    
    I'm about to fly
    
    Rain on me (Rain on me)
    
    I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive (Rain on me)
    
    Rain on me, rain, rain
    
    Rain on me, rain, rain (Rain on me)
    
    I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive (At least I'm alive)
    
    Rain on me, rain, rain (Rain on me)
    
    Rain on me (Rain on me)
    
    I hear the thunder coming down
    
    Won't you rain on me?
    
    Eh, eh, yeah (Rain on, woo)
    
    I hear the thunder coming down
