  <h2>Lyrics</h2>
  <p id="lyrics">
    Take my hand, stay Joanne

Heaven's not ready for you

Every part of my aching heart

Needs you more than the angels do

Girl, where do you think you're goin'?

Where do you think you're goin', goin', girl?

Girl, where do you think you're goin'?

Where do you think you're goin', goin', girl?

If you could, I know that you'd stay

We both know things don't work that way

I promised I wouldn't say goodbye

So I grin and my voice gets thin

Girl, where do you think you're goin'?

Where do you think you're goin', goin', girl?

Girl, where do you think you're goin'?

Where do you think you're goin', goin', girl?

Honestly, I know where you're goin'

And baby, you're just movin' on

And I'll still love you even if I can't

See you anymore, can't wait to see you soar

Girl, where do you think you're goin'?

Where do you think you're goin', goin', girl?

Girl, where do you think you're goin'?

Where do you think you're goin', goin', girl?
