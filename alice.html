  <h2>Lyrics</h2>
  <p id="lyrics">
    My name isn't Alice

    But I'll keep looking, I'll keep looking for Wonderland
    
    My name isn't Alice
    
    But I'll keep looking, I'll keep looking for Wonderland, Wonderland
    
    Ah-ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ah
    
    Set me free
    
    Ah-ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ah
    
    Set me free
    
    Could you pull me out of this alive?
    
    Where's my body? I'm stuck in my mind
    
    Oh-ma-ma-ma, oh-ma-ma-ma
    
    I'm tired of screaming
    
    Oh-ma-ma-ma, oh-ma-ma-ma
    
    At the top of my lungs
    
    Oh my mother, oh my mother
    
    I'm in the hole, I'm falling down, down, so down, down
    
    My name isn't Alice
    
    But I'll keep looking, I'll keep looking for Wonderland
    
    My name isn't Alice
    
    But I'll keep looking, I'll keep looking for Wonderland, Wonderland
    
    Take me home
    
    Take me to Wonderland, Wonderland
    
    Take me home
    
    Take me to Wonderland, Wonderland
    
    Sick and tired of waking up
    
    Screaming at the top of my lungs
    
    Thinking I might have just left myself behind
    
    Maestro, play me your symphony
    
    I will listen to anything
    
    Take me on trip, DJ, free my mind
    
    My name isn't Alice
    
    But I'll keep looking, I'll keep looking for Wonderland
    
    My name isn't Alice
    
    But I'll keep looking, I'll keep looking for Wonderland, Wonderland
    
    Take me home
    
    Take me to Wonderland, Wonderland
    
    Take me home
    
    Take me to Wonderland, Wonderland
    
    Take me home
    
    Take me to Wonderland, Wonderland
    
    Take me home
    
    Take me to Wonderland, Wonderland
    
    Ah-ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ah-oh
    
    Set me free
    
    Ah-ah-ah-oh, ah
